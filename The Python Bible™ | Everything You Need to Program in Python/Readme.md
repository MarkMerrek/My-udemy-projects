In **Health Potion**, I created a simple program that simulates a healing potion in a video game. Upon usage, it adds a random amount of health, depending on the game's difficulty.

The **Email Slicer** project involves a simple program that takes the user's email address and slices out the username and domain name.

**Travis** is a project where a program was created to simulate a robot named Travis. Travis maintains a list of users and, when launched, asks the user for a name. If the name isn't on the list, the user can add it. If the name is already on the list, the user can either remove it or leave it as it is.

The **Cinema Simulator** project uses a dictionary of movies. The user is asked which movie they would like to watch. If the movie is in the dictionary, the program asks for the user's age (and displays a corresponding message if the user is too young) and checks the number of available seats. If there are enough free seats, the program reduces the available seats for that movie by one and prints the message, "Enjoy the film!" If there are no seats available, it informs the user that the movie is sold out.

The **Baby** project simulates a babyâ€™s behavior by asking random questions. After the user responds, the program continuously asks "Why?" until the user types "just because," at which point the loop ends.

**Pig Latin** is an interesting project that converts the user's message into Pig Latin.

The **Game** project is a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python, featuring a board and two players.

The **Bank** project is a program that utilizes Python classes to simulate a bank. Users can deposit money, withdraw funds, or view their current balance.
